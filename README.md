# CarbonYield — Public Overview

🌱 **CarbonYield** is a sale-powered, credit-regenerative climate platform that transforms one-time contributions into visible, multi-cycle participation in verified climate impact.

This repo provides a transparent public reference of how CarbonYield works — including platform logic, architecture, legal safeguards, and the Impact Cycle powering regeneration.

> “You didn’t just support impact. You’re still part of the cycle.”

## 🔄 How the Impact Cycle Works

**Step-by-step:**

1. **User contributes** to the platform’s pooled climate fund.
2. **Impact Credits are issued** (10 per $1), representing participation — not financial value.
3. **User assigns credits** to project categories like reforestation or clean energy.
4. **Platform selects and funds verified projects** based on category weights.
5. **Carbon credits are sold** by the platform (post-MVP).
6. **Credits are regenerated** by the platform and reissued to past contributors.
7. **Users reuse regenerated credits** to guide future impact — continuing the cycle.

Impact Credits are internal-use-only, never financial or tradable. Regeneration is platform-controlled and discretionary. Reuse is manual unless auto-reuse is enabled after inactivity.
