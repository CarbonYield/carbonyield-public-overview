# CarbonYield – Public Overview

Welcome! This site shares the public architecture, regeneration model, and platform logic behind **CarbonYield** — a climate-fintech project I designed and built to turn one-time contributions into multi-cycle verified climate impact.

If you're a **recruiter**, **funder**, or **collaborator**, this overview shows:
- How CarbonYield’s **Impact Cycle** works
- How the platform regenerates credits based on carbon credit resale
- Why it’s structurally different from donation platforms or token-based systems
- What safeguards are in place to ensure compliance, transparency, and non-financial participation
