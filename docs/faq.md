# Strategic FAQ

This FAQ explains CarbonYield’s core logic, legal boundaries, and user experience. Each answer is grounded in platform safeguards and regeneration flow.

## 🧩 Platform Logic

**Q: How do users guide what gets funded?**  
Users assign Impact Credits to climate categories (e.g., reforestation, clean energy). The platform uses these signals to allocate funding.  
> Users never choose specific projects — only category influence is supported.

**Q: What are Impact Credits?**  
Internal-use-only units issued at 10 credits per $1 contributed. They guide platform logic, but carry no financial value.  
> They are participation markers — not tokens or assets.

**Q: What happens after I assign credits?**  
The platform selects and funds verified projects within your chosen categories. Later, it regenerates new credits back to you, powered by sale or reserves.

## 🔁 Regeneration & Reuse

**Q: Do I get more credits over time?**  
Yes — if you previously participated and the platform regenerates credits in your category, they’ll appear in your dashboard.

**Q: Can I reuse those regenerated credits?**  
Yes. Reuse is always manual by default. You can reassign credits to guide future impact cycles — without paying again.

**Q: What if I forget to log back in?**  
After 90 days of inactivity, the platform may auto-reuse your regenerated credits based on your last preferences. You can opt out anytime.

**Q: Is this a rewards program?**  
No. Regeneration is a **non-financial signal** — not a reward, payout, or return.

## 💸 Sale & Revenue

**Q: How does the platform generate revenue?**  
CarbonYield resells verified carbon credits to vetted buyers and retains 100% of sale proceeds. These proceeds support regeneration and platform operations.

**Q: Do I get a portion of the sale value?**  
No. Users never receive money or credits tied to sale price. Impact Credits are symbolic and reused within the platform.

**Q: What if sale doesn’t happen?**  
During MVP, CarbonYield uses internal reserves (5–10%) to simulate regeneration. After MVP, regeneration continues only when sales succeed.

## 🔐 Legal & Safety

**Q: Is this an investment or donation?**  
Neither. Contributions are pooled support — not donations (no tax receipt), and not investments (no returns).

**Q: Do I ever own carbon credits?**  
No. Credits are never issued to users. CarbonYield holds sale rights and contracts with verified developers, but does not act as a registry or token platform.

**Q: Is there any blockchain involved?**  
No. CarbonYield is built on secure Web2 infrastructure: Firebase, Netlify, and Formspree.

## 🏗 Platform Development

**Q: Can developers apply to be listed?**  
Yes. Verified project developers can apply through our intake process. The first 100 accepted projects receive lifetime free listing.

**Q: Does listing guarantee funding?**  
No. Projects are selected based on user-assigned category weight and platform discretion.

**Q: What makes this platform different?**  
CarbonYield offers recurring influence — not one-time transactions. There’s no speculation, no token, and no payout. Just visible, regenerative climate participation.
