## UX Safeguards

CarbonYield’s UX is designed to reinforce emotional clarity, not financial speculation.

**Do:**
- Emphasize participation, guidance, and continuity
- Highlight user influence at the category level
- Use dashboards and badges to visualize ongoing impact

**Don’t:**
- Use language like "earn", "redeem", or "invest"
- Show ROI, pricing charts, or wallet-style features
- Imply ownership of carbon credits or sale proceeds

> 📌 All Impact Credit behavior is explained clearly at point-of-use via tooltips and modal messages.

## Core UX Rules

| Feature         | Rule                                                                 |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Impact Credits | Always shown as symbolic markers of participation                    |
| Regeneration    | Clearly labeled as platform-issued, not earned or automatic          |
| Reuse           | Manual by default; auto-reuse only after 90 days (opt-out enabled)   |
| Badges          | Based on meaningful behavior (e.g. reuse), never spending            |
| Sale Logs       | Publicly visible, but anonymized and category-level only             |

2. **No carbon credit distribution** — Credits are resold at the platform level only.
3. **No financial misrepresentation** — All user-facing copy avoids return-based framing.
4. **No donation mislabeling** — Contributions are classified as pooled platform support.
