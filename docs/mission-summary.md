# Mission Summary

## What CarbonYield Solves

Most people want to support real climate action — but today’s systems are built for institutions, not individuals.

CarbonYield was created to solve three major problems:

### 1. No Public Access to Verified Climate Impact

Verified carbon credits are usually reserved for brokers and institutional buyers. The public is offered low-quality offsets with no transparency or long-term influence.

> **CarbonYield gives individuals a visible role in verified climate funding.**

---

### 2. No Continuity After First Action

Most climate platforms treat a donation like a receipt: one-time, passive, and final.

> CarbonYield keeps users involved across cycles — without needing to pay again.

---

### 3. Speculation Disguised as Participation

Many newer platforms rely on tokens, NFTs, or investment-style mechanics that confuse users and introduce legal risk.

> CarbonYield is non-financial, platform-controlled, and built for emotional and behavioral participation — not speculation.

## What CarbonYield Is

**CarbonYield is a sale-powered, credit-regenerative climate platform.**

- Users contribute to a pooled climate fund.
- They receive **Impact Credits** (internal-use-only units).
- They assign credits to project categories they care about.
- The platform funds real projects and resells verified carbon credits.
- **Credits are regenerated** and sent back to users.
- Users **reuse** those credits to shape what gets funded next.

> “One contribution becomes a multi-cycle force for verified change.”
