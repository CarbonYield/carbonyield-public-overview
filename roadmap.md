# CarbonYield Roadmap

🛠️ This roadmap outlines our MVP goals, post-MVP vision, and long-term direction for CarbonYield — a sale-powered, credit-regenerative climate platform.

## 🎯 MVP Goals (June–July 2025)

The MVP is designed to validate **behavioral participation** — not financial return.

**Objectives:**
- Launch a working contribution interface
- Issue internal-use-only Impact Credits (10 per $1)
- Allow users to assign credits to project categories
- Simulate sale logs and regeneration flow
- Let users reuse regenerated credits (manual by default)
- Unlock visible badges for multi-cycle participation

**Core Features:**
- ✅ User dashboard with credit tracking
- ✅ Credit assignment flow
- ✅ Regeneration simulation via reserve logic (5–10%)
- ✅ Manual and auto-reuse (with opt-out)
- ✅ Badge system: Multi-Cycle Contributor, Forest Guardian, etc.
- 🟡 Sample project marketplace (by category, not per-project)
- 🟡 Simulated sale logs (category-level)

> 📌 No tokens, no financial return, no carbon credits issued to users.

**Planned Features:**
- 🟢 Live sale log system (category-level buyers, pricing, tons sold)
- 🟢 Project developer intake with verification criteria
- 🟢 Community project visibility tools (badges, campaign stats)
- 🟢 AI-powered impact summaries for each contributor
- 🟢 Impact Portfolio: track all assigned, regenerated, and reused credits

---

## 🔮 2026 & Beyond

**Future priorities:**
- Full API integration with registries (Verra, Plan Vivo, etc.)
- Third-party project audits and AI-based risk flagging
- Organizational dashboard licensing (for ESG-aligned partners)
- Sale partner ecosystem (brokers, climate funds)

---

## 📌 Our Focus

CarbonYield is not a marketplace or credit wallet.
We are a regeneration-based climate engine built for:

- Visible continuity of support
- Behavioral participation
- Verified impact — not speculation

> “One act of support becomes a lasting signal — shaping verified climate funding again and again.”
